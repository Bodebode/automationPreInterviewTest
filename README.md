Automation pre-interview test 
Readme
...........

There are a number of noteworthy observations that needs to be addressed.
The test steps are wrong (incomplete to be precise). A complete workable automation cannot be built around it as it has many missing steps.

Solution: I’ve filled in the blanks in order to make the automation executable hence why the code is longer than expected.
I can explain this further if required.

The actual website has some Critical/Major bugs that will cause unnecessary blockage for automation especially during regression tests. 

Users will be unable to register with a correct detail once an incorrect detail has been previously entered and the user attempts correction. 

Error message is also not correct, it doesn't indicate the actual error that is supposed to inform the user of the correction that is required for a successful registration.
I’m happy to elaborate further if required
